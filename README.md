This repository contains the materials of group 128 for the course "02456 Deep learning" (DTU).
The project was supervised by Teresa Dorszewski.

Group members:
- Marco Andreis: s243116
- Rasmus Porsgaard: s203953
- Csilla Duray: 233903 

In terms of execution the project was divided into:
- data processing, which is computationally intensive and needed to be done in batches to avoid problems memory allocation using pyarrow (01_data_processing.py). 
- convexity analysis of the base model using the 04_analysis.py, which lead to us to prune the base model (using 07_manual_pruning.py) producing 12 different version of the architecture (from just the feature extractor to the full model). We then performed the finetuning (01_finetuning.py) and the validation (03_model_validation.py).
- finetuning of the base wav2vec (01_finetuning.py) and similarity analysis, the results of which can be found in the analysis_results folder and guided the process of post-training pruning (pruning was done both with the 05_pruning.py scripts, which also performs validation, and then with the 07_manual_pruning.py script, which produced models that were tested with the 03_model_validation.py script).
- training and testing of a CNN.

All the computation was carried out using the HPC Tesla A100 queue (gpua100). 
The raw and processed data, as well as all the finetuned models are available in the drive folder linked above.

As can be seen the project makes intense use of many scripts that where run multiple times for testing and evalutation of many different models (done through parsing different paths in the python files), with the main results being the comparison of the performance of these models which are recorded in the validation_results folder. For this reason we could not find a suitable way of creating a notebook capable of summarizing the results of the project.
